Misleading Title  After purchasing this CD I was shocked to discover it was not Bread
Mr. Young   the patriot  Amazing
the best specials album  This is a great album. It is not really ;live; it;s not recorded before an audience
Shoulda been a contender.  Terry Reid had everything go wrong during his career (lack of promotion
There;s A Big Difference Between Good And Great  First off I want to say i;m a fan of Chris Rea
Incredible  Little Things
 Searching for meaning   and finding it  I just typed  Hasselhoff  into an online German English translator 
Warm  This was the third album Mathis made for Columbia
BEWARE This is an Asian Group It is NOT JUDE from AMERICA  This CD is all in another language.  It is not JUDE as we know him.  It is JUDE
The absolute best jazz vocal album ever  If I could give 10 stars to this album
Heartbreaking and Gorgeous  The premise and songs on Watertown will affect anyone who has been through a divorce. Sinatra;s imperfect voice makes his performance all the more moving. He conveys pain
Original  When you pass by a CD shelf in a store
Awesome CD   but go for the US Import (it;s cheaper )  Disc O zone does not in any way fit into my collection. Tom Waits
The Ultimate Sound  When I die and waft to heaven upon wings feathered with sound and  emotions
He had me from Airhead  When I first heard ;Airhead; on the radio
FAB  this is a great CD of an awesome Portuguese Rock band     
Excentric  this is as far the most strange and excentric McCArtney album ever.he closed himself in a studio with sythesisers
 ...Good times coming   Press to play  features one of paul best songs ever   these are  Strangehold    amazing rocker  Talk more talk    tribute to peter gabriel sound...  Good times coming    psychedelic reagge funk  Footprints    haunting ballad  Press    cheerfull dancefloor hit  Prettly little head    dark and mystical trip to subconcious  However absurd    beatless styled ballad. the rest of songs are not that good but it really doesn;t matter if you got these songs because they make this album. Paul experiments here with modern sounds     Pretty little head  or  Talk more talk  are his only songs like this he ever made... Oue de soleil  from FLOWERS IN THE DIRT is propably the end of his flirting with modern electronic beats that he started here. Paul showed his wierd side here   definitly one of his most interesting and bizzare songs are here...      
Back to the Egg  it is definitly one of Paul;s most interesting and bizzare albums   he mixes here so many conventions and style such as Zeppelin styled hard rock
 what happened to Mike?  This is his weakest album ever since.even on his weak albums he wrote some tunes that were stayig in head more than 1 hour.here all songs are boring and sleepy...after 3 listenings you can;t remember any catchy or nice riff (maybe except sweet  Return to origin ).saimple and unoriginal new age music.perfect for listening in expensive hotel elevators      
 A CLASS ACT  I am a 35 yr old male who recently discovered this late great entertainer through a wonderful Spanish radio station (92.3 CLASSICA 92) that specializes in those great songs of yesteryear  this collection brings together all of the albums that Nino recorded during his all too brief lifetime. Passion and soul infuse every number....the songs are timeless ....  in this world of Britneys and Justins and Jessica Simpsons sadly topping the charts....it is nice to have recordings like these to show us that having a voice and being able to actually sing a song without any  machine support  is what its all about  Nino was a true class act and his musical legacy will always live on.....buy this compilation you will not be disappointed      
 A wonderful retelling of some of Tull;s greatest songs  Aqualung is considered a  classic rock  album 
Best so far   This album is great fun
WOW  This is the greatest music ever made.  This is the shallowest music ever made.  It is so profound.  It is darker than their earlier albums
surprised  i always forget about import cds  I of course haven;t heard of this album in the States like on radio stations or whatever   but was surprised at how much Matt Bellamy sounds just like Thom Yorke.. which made me pretty happy.  The music is different even though their voices are similar.   If you really know nothing about the band (which I didn;t prior to buying this cd) then something decent to go by is this: if you like Thom Yorke;s voice (from Radiohead) and the moody tunes that Radiohead puts out... add a little more rock to that and you have Muse.  At least on this cd.  Songs 1 5 on this cd blew my mind
 Amazing  If you already own  Frances the Mute  and have truely gotten to know it 
Ultimate Millie  This is Millie doing what she does best telling it like it is. I have been a fan for awhile and she always seems to amaze me. She is definitely an entertainer worth having in your collection. If you think her recordings are something
Fueron lo m ximo hasta que...  Definitivamente
