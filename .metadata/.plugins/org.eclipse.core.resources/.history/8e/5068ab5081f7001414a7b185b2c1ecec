the most manufactured piece of rubbish anyware in the world  god I hate this album and every song on it. I hate westlife and their simpering boyband plastic pop pap. In Britian
Lou Reed is God  I started out a velvets purist.  I guess all the leather and the CHP glasses gave me an incorrect impression of his solo stuff.  Golly Gee I was wrong.  Not the first time.  These 3 cd;s are mandatory (these are the only ones I have).  After a few listens I started to get it and gradually fell in love with the cleverness and charm of these musical gems.  Lou is life.  a mass of contradictions.  mainstream and not so mainstream.  clean and out of his mind. humble and conceited.  He;s throwing it out there for real? or is it tonguencheek?  or does it fluctuate?  constantly eluding himself? full circle and back again and still untouchable.  take it for what it is. impossible to pin and beyond categorization.  One of the all time greatest cds for hangovers as well.       
NOT a soundtrack   save your money if that;s what you want....  I don;t know what this is
just awesome  this is one of my favorite songs.i absolutely love it i suggest to get the complete album. i am pretty sure you won;t regret it.     
nice.   A lot of people say Marion Raven is working the same formula as Avril Lavigne and Kelly Clarkson used
Kiki Dee   Elton John at their Best  I do not have either this CD (Amoureuse) or the original LP in my collection+ADs- but I do have the LP
Found it 15 Years Later  I have been searching for Accepts Staying a Life 2CD set for the last 15 years Unlike the American version the German Import is much better and has an additional 4 tracks on it. The additional songs that are missing from the American release are: Head Over Heels Burning Neon Nights Outro (Bound to Fail) Also the American version is not a 2 CD set. If you are a hardcore Accept fan
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE   Like so many others
Fela rises up on the west coast  This Boxed CD set contains many of the Great Fela songs
Songs from the collective consciousness  Great music.  Go beyond the surface
Finally  This is Sadao Watanabe at his finest  Backed by a superb group of all star backup musicians such as Eric Gale and Steve Gadd
Ruggiero Ricci at his absolute best   We all should be fortunate that Ruggiero Ricci is a prolific recording artist and that every stage of his career is on disc. These 1952
Third Volume of the Legend of Dance Music Series Highlighting Larry Levan;s Paradise Garage(This is an import released in Japan)    For some reason none of the websites that sell this CD have the tracklist
Something to listen to while sitting on a very different park bench  Let me get this through to you as soon as possible+ADs- This is not your (insert relative here);s Aqualung LP. This is not your Aqualung CD. If you really must know
 The Human League CRASHED literally on this one  It is hard to believe that the band that brought us such masterpieces as  Being Boiled  
Great group of CD;s  I always give MOS a chance when it comes to their CD compilations
Superb   Like Freddy And The Dreamers of the 60;s  This is a fantastic album.  Very upbeat with hidden dark passages...much like Freddy And The Dreamers of the 1960;s.  This is a great album to listen to time and time again....it sounds different each time I play it.  Beautiful and very soft and mello.  Cuckoo ForCeltic     
Too Great of An Album
BREATH TAKING   This CD has left me speechless  It was such a pleasant surprise and I have been hooked since my first listen.  I;m a H U G E Meshell fan
Heartfelt
Intestine Shaka  I was down on my luck and empty on the bottle when I heard the screeching ape squeels of Darwin Harcklefarber oozing from ten foot speakers in a local ghetto for the first time. I ordered it from Amazon that afternoon
Great Jazz
Another UNKLE classic  If you like creative beats and eclectic breaks   this is for you.     
 Opening the doors for melodic death metal...   Always  was an album truly before its time.   Released in 1993 
Even 22 Years Later
A Real Disappointment  After really enjoying the Amici Forever album
TY for the suggestion to buy from amazon.uk   I love this 2 cd set
Nirvana ripped them off  If you buy this album
...my review pt.2  let me just add to my review below
very good listen  overall NIN
some of the BEST MUSIC you could ever buy  i;m relatively new to the coil listening experience. (thats what it is)   an experience. yet
Very good  Hey This is a really good prog band. Maybe the best in Europe. 1 star? You;re just kidding Pablo.     
Unconditionally Guaranteed  This is a really good album. Some say that this is the worst album of Beefheart
Good for techno fans
 Music to my ears  If you were disappointed by Darude;s  Before The Storm  album and want to find better songs from him 
An underlooked DJ  Tomcraft is an often underlooked DJ. According to DJ Mag
This song is a classic  If you have ever been to a club before
Give it a chance  This is the first song that I have listened to from Angel City. It;s an interesting one with catchy tunes. I;m not familar with Angel City or Lara Mcallen
Can you say Jigga Jigga?  If you;re not familiar with techno
Can you say Jigga Jigga?  If you;re not familiar with techno
Another hit by Milk Inc  The Sun Always Shines On TV is another great hit by the Belgian group Milk Inc. The song is very easy to listen to and the vocals done by Linda Mertens are absolutely wonderful. The beat is very catchy. I;ve listened to Milk Inc;s songs for quite some time now
Wonderful but flawed  First the good news. This album brings together many of the most powerful and enchanting performances by Shirley Bassey and
how does this relate to anne?  I HAVE TO SAY THESE CELTIC SONGS ARE GREAT BUT TO BE MORE EXACT
When I was in Paris....  A few weeks ago
 Interesting Music  One reviewer called this album  Disappointing 
Ohhh Soooo Goooood      People of Earth....Here are 14 songs from Powderfinger;s front man....each one a gem. This is truly wonderful. Don;t let the price of this CD stop you...it;s well worth the cash. If you have time
What was he thinking?  I can not believe that this turned out so badly. I was waiting forever for the re release
This Isn;t Your Fathers PdP   WOW What a recording and what a change of style for the new PdP. There is still some resemblence to the other material
What a pleasant surprise  I have always enjoyed Ange
Mystical Folk Rock  I just listened to this for the first time. It is really wonderful and refreshing. The interplay between musicians is quite magical actually
80;s High Tech with Rock Emotion  Although all of Mr Hines work is high quality
A combination of all Oldfields ingrediants and talents.  I thought
top  3 trance songs of all time  Yes
mislabeled..but this cd is on fire   Yes
worth the price  Ive recenlty become enamored to the AVB sound that has become pure ear candy.   After hearing his 004 Transparance and some of remixes
perfectly orchestrated album  This double album was definitely worth the price. The first album has some beautiful melodies. The first track is a good one to start out with. The second track is the beautiful melodic Way OUt West Mindcircus. From there
Finally his journey has started  My opinions might be subjective since I like Tarkan a lot and I am Turkish.  I believe Tarkan is the best Turkish singer in Turkey  ...  and he is one of the best in the world
 .   i had just introduced one of my friends to hikki and was complaining to him that she hadnt come out with anything since end of 2002. so i took a trip to her website and saw the announcement for her new single. after the disappointment of exodus
and i wish it wish it could have been better...  I had big expectations for this CD.  After ;Eternal Nightcap;
Fine debut Solo album from former LRB lead singer.  This record was made almost immeadiatly after Glenn left LRB in early 1982. The album was produced by John Boylan who had produced the LRB albums Diamantina Cocktail
A Definite Step Back  Maybe I was expecting way too much.  I would easily give EOE and NFB 5 stars each.  This album is just way too bland.  Even the hooks don;t get me.  Hard to explain   it;s just very average
One of Bolan;s best.   I bought this cd thinking it would have a few decent songs after reading the reviews
get this one  Get THIS cd cover (white
 Best track isn;t even on the album  I bought this album the day it came out in the U.S. with high hopes after loving  Back To The Egg .  Boy oh boy 
Very good album
 great song  ok ok i;ve only heard one Powderfinger song which is called  Grave Concern . It was on a muti artist disc put out  in 1994 by  Kahlua liquor and Juice magazine.This is one of the most powerfully sonic songs i have ever heard.Crank up your speakers and run the cats  
This is not Planet P  Beware
listen here...  please don;t listen to some of the other reviews of this album who say its boring or too long.if you are mature enough to appreciate good musicianship and good melody than this is a must buy.the 22 minute track is how they did it sometimes in those days and its refreshing in this day and age to hear.it rocks.it is easy going at times but still very enjoyable.     
A proper reveiw on Nightwish for a change.  THIS ALBUM SUCKS. ANYBODY SUCKERING YOU INTO BUYING IT SUCKS.  ANYBODY THAT GIVES THIS MORE THAN 1 STAR SUCKS.  TO SOME UP
Misleading Title  After purchasing this CD I was shocked to discover it was not Bread
Mr. Young   the patriot  Amazing
the best specials album  This is a great album. It is not really ;live; it;s not recorded before an audience
Shoulda been a contender.  Terry Reid had everything go wrong during his career (lack of promotion
There;s A Big Difference Between Good And Great  First off I want to say i;m a fan of Chris Rea
Incredible  Little Things
 Searching for meaning   and finding it  I just typed  Hasselhoff  into an online German English translator 
Warm  This was the third album Mathis made for Columbia
BEWARE This is an Asian Group It is NOT JUDE from AMERICA  This CD is all in another language.  It is not JUDE as we know him.  It is JUDE
The absolute best jazz vocal album ever  If I could give 10 stars to this album
Heartbreaking and Gorgeous  The premise and songs on Watertown will affect anyone who has been through a divorce. Sinatra;s imperfect voice makes his performance all the more moving. He conveys pain
Original  When you pass by a CD shelf in a store
Awesome CD   but go for the US Import (it;s cheaper )  Disc O zone does not in any way fit into my collection. Tom Waits
The Ultimate Sound  When I die and waft to heaven upon wings feathered with sound and  emotions
He had me from Airhead  When I first heard ;Airhead; on the radio
FAB  this is a great CD of an awesome Portuguese Rock band     
Excentric  this is as far the most strange and excentric McCArtney album ever.he closed himself in a studio with sythesisers
 ...Good times coming   Press to play  features one of paul best songs ever   these are  Strangehold    amazing rocker  Talk more talk    tribute to peter gabriel sound...  Good times coming    psychedelic reagge funk  Footprints    haunting ballad  Press    cheerfull dancefloor hit  Prettly little head    dark and mystical trip to subconcious  However absurd    beatless styled ballad. the rest of songs are not that good but it really doesn;t matter if you got these songs because they make this album. Paul experiments here with modern sounds     Pretty little head  or  Talk more talk  are his only songs like this he ever made... Oue de soleil  from FLOWERS IN THE DIRT is propably the end of his flirting with modern electronic beats that he started here. Paul showed his wierd side here   definitly one of his most interesting and bizzare songs are here...      
Back to the Egg  it is definitly one of Paul;s most interesting and bizzare albums   he mixes here so many conventions and style such as Zeppelin styled hard rock
 what happened to Mike?  This is his weakest album ever since.even on his weak albums he wrote some tunes that were stayig in head more than 1 hour.here all songs are boring and sleepy...after 3 listenings you can;t remember any catchy or nice riff (maybe except sweet  Return to origin ).saimple and unoriginal new age music.perfect for listening in expensive hotel elevators      
 A CLASS ACT  I am a 35 yr old male who recently discovered this late great entertainer through a wonderful Spanish radio station (92.3 CLASSICA 92) that specializes in those great songs of yesteryear  this collection brings together all of the albums that Nino recorded during his all too brief lifetime. Passion and soul infuse every number....the songs are timeless ....  in this world of Britneys and Justins and Jessica Simpsons sadly topping the charts....it is nice to have recordings like these to show us that having a voice and being able to actually sing a song without any  machine support  is what its all about  Nino was a true class act and his musical legacy will always live on.....buy this compilation you will not be disappointed      
 A wonderful retelling of some of Tull;s greatest songs  Aqualung is considered a  classic rock  album 
Best so far   This album is great fun
WOW  This is the greatest music ever made.  This is the shallowest music ever made.  It is so profound.  It is darker than their earlier albums
surprised  i always forget about import cds  I of course haven;t heard of this album in the States like on radio stations or whatever   but was surprised at how much Matt Bellamy sounds just like Thom Yorke.. which made me pretty happy.  The music is different even though their voices are similar.   If you really know nothing about the band (which I didn;t prior to buying this cd) then something decent to go by is this: if you like Thom Yorke;s voice (from Radiohead) and the moody tunes that Radiohead puts out... add a little more rock to that and you have Muse.  At least on this cd.  Songs 1 5 on this cd blew my mind
 Amazing  If you already own  Frances the Mute  and have truely gotten to know it 
Ultimate Millie  This is Millie doing what she does best telling it like it is. I have been a fan for awhile and she always seems to amaze me. She is definitely an entertainer worth having in your collection. If you think her recordings are something
Fueron lo m ximo hasta que...  Definitivamente
 Be Warned: This Is  NOT  the Beulah You;re Thinking Of...  There;s only one  Beulah
