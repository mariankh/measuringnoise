 what happened to Mike?  This is his weakest album ever since.even on his weak albums he wrote some tunes that were stayig in head more than 1 hour.here all songs are boring and sleepy...after 3 listenings you can;t remember any catchy or nice riff (maybe except sweet  Return to origin ).saimple and unoriginal new age music.perfect for listening in expensive hotel elevators      
 A wonderful retelling of some of Tull;s greatest songs  Aqualung is considered a  classic rock  album 
Best so far   This album is great fun
WOW  This is the greatest music ever made.  This is the shallowest music ever made.  It is so profound.  It is darker than their earlier albums
 Amazing  If you already own  Frances the Mute  and have truely gotten to know it 
Ultimate Millie  This is Millie doing what she does best telling it like it is. I have been a fan for awhile and she always seems to amaze me. She is definitely an entertainer worth having in your collection. If you think her recordings are something
Fueron lo m ximo hasta que...  Definitivamente
 Be Warned: This Is  NOT  the Beulah You;re Thinking Of...  There;s only one  Beulah  
Rednecks love him too  Me and my man were cruising for a real romantic night on the town.  We had left our 14 children with their grandfather
Cliff Richard : King of UK music  Cliff Richard is the most sucessfull domestic recoring artist of all time with over 120 U.K hit singles under his belt
