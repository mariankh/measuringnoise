the most manufactured piece of rubbish anyware in the world  god I hate this album and every song on it. I hate westlife and their simpering boyband plastic pop pap. In Britian
Lou Reed is God  I started out a velvets purist.  I guess all the leather and the CHP glasses gave me an incorrect impression of his solo stuff.  Golly Gee I was wrong.  Not the first time.  These 3 cd's are mandatory (these are the only ones I have).  After a few listens I started to get it and gradually fell in love with the cleverness and charm of these musical gems.  Lou is life.  a mass of contradictions.  mainstream and not so mainstream.  clean and out of his mind. humble and conceited.  He's throwing it out there for real? or is it tonguencheek?  or does it fluctuate?  constantly eluding himself? full circle and back again and still untouchable.  take it for what it is. impossible to pin and beyond categorization.  One of the all time greatest cds for hangovers as well.       
NOT a soundtrack - save your money if that's what you want....  I don't know what this is
just awesome!  this is one of my favorite songs.i absolutely love it! i suggest to get the complete album. i am pretty sure you won't regret it.     
nice.   A lot of people say Marion Raven is working the same formula as Avril Lavigne and Kelly Clarkson used
Kiki Dee & Elton John at their Best!  I do not have either this CD (Amoureuse) or the original LP in my collection; but I do have the LP
Found it 15 Years Later!  I have been searching for Accepts Staying a Life 2CD set for the last 15 years! Unlike the American version the German Import is much better and has an additional 4 tracks on it. The additional songs that are missing from the American release are: Head Over Heels Burning Neon Nights Outro (Bound to Fail) Also the American version is not a 2 CD set. If you are a hardcore Accept fan
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!!!  Like so many others
Fela rises up on the west coast  This Boxed CD set contains many of the Great Fela songs
Songs from the collective consciousness  Great music.  Go beyond the surface
Finally!  This is Sadao Watanabe at his finest!  Backed by a superb group of all-star backup musicians such as Eric Gale and Steve Gadd
Ruggiero Ricci at his absolute best!!  We all should be fortunate that Ruggiero Ricci is a prolific recording artist and that every stage of his career is on disc. These 1952
Third Volume of the Legend of Dance Music Series Highlighting Larry Levan's Paradise Garage(This is an import released in Japan)    For some reason none of the websites that sell this CD have the tracklist
Something to listen to while sitting on a very different park bench  Let me get this through to you as soon as possible; This is not your (insert relative here)'s Aqualung LP. This is not your Aqualung CD. If you really must know
The Human League CRASHED literally on this one!  It is hard to believe that the band that brought us such masterpieces as "Being Boiled"
Great group of CD's  I always give MOS a chance when it comes to their CD compilations
Superb!!  Like Freddy And The Dreamers of the 60's  This is a fantastic album.  Very upbeat with hidden dark passages...much like Freddy And The Dreamers of the 1960's.  This is a great album to listen to time and time again....it sounds different each time I play it.  Beautiful and very soft and mello.  Cuckoo ForCeltic     
Catchy
Too Great of An Album
Another UNKLE classic  If you like creative beats and eclectic breaks - this is for you.     
Opening the doors for melodic death metal...  "Always" was an album truly before its time.   Released in 1993
some of the BEST MUSIC you could ever buy  i'm relatively new to the coil listening-experience.-(thats what it is)-  an experience. yet
Heh?  Well
Very good  Hey! This is a really good prog band. Maybe the best in Europe. 1 star?! You're just kidding Pablo.     
Not Tragic
Unconditionally Guaranteed  This is a really good album. Some say that this is the worst album of Beefheart
Good for techno fans
Very
Music to my ears  If you were disappointed by Darude's "Before The Storm" album and want to find better songs from him
An underlooked DJ  Tomcraft is an often underlooked DJ. According to DJ Mag
This song is a classic!  If you have ever been to a club before
Give it a chance  This is the first song that I have listened to from Angel City. It's an interesting one with catchy tunes. I'm not familar with Angel City or Lara Mcallen
Can you say Jigga Jigga?  If you're not familiar with techno
Can you say Jigga Jigga?  If you're not familiar with techno
Another hit by Milk Inc!  The Sun Always Shines On TV is another great hit by the Belgian group Milk Inc. The song is very easy to listen to and the vocals done by Linda Mertens are absolutely wonderful. The beat is very catchy. I've listened to Milk Inc's songs for quite some time now
Wonderful but flawed  First the good news. This album brings together many of the most powerful and enchanting performances by Shirley Bassey and
how does this relate to anne?  I HAVE TO SAY THESE CELTIC SONGS ARE GREAT BUT TO BE MORE EXACT
When I was in Paris....  A few weeks ago
Interesting Music  One reviewer called this album "Disappointing
Very good album
great song  ok ok i've only heard one Powderfinger song which is called "Grave Concern". It was on a muti-artist disc put out  in 1994 by  Kahlua liquor and Juice magazine.This is one of the most powerfully sonic songs i have ever heard.Crank up your speakers and run the cats 
This is not Planet P  Beware
listen here...  please don't listen to some of the other reviews of this album who say its boring or too long.if you are mature enough to appreciate good musicianship and good melody than this is a must buy.the 22 minute track is how they did it sometimes in those days and its refreshing in this day and age to hear.it rocks.it is easy going at times but still very enjoyable.     
A proper reveiw on Nightwish for a change.  THIS ALBUM SUCKS. ANYBODY SUCKERING YOU INTO BUYING IT SUCKS.  ANYBODY THAT GIVES THIS MORE THAN 1 STAR SUCKS.  TO SOME UP
Misleading Title  After purchasing this CD I was shocked to discover it was not Bread
Warm  This was the third album Mathis made for Columbia
The Ultimate Sound  When I die and waft to heaven upon wings feathered with sound and  emotions
He had me from Airhead  When I first heard 'Airhead' on the radio
FAB!  this is a great CD of an awesome Portuguese Rock band!     
Excentric  this is as far the most strange and excentric McCArtney album ever.he closed himself in a studio with sythesisers
WOW!  This is the greatest music ever made.  This is the shallowest music ever made.  It is so profound.  It is darker than their earlier albums
surprised!  i always forget about import cds  I of course haven't heard of this album in the States like on radio stations or whatever - but was surprised at how much Matt Bellamy sounds just like Thom Yorke.. which made me pretty happy.  The music is different even though their voices are similar.   If you really know nothing about the band (which I didn't prior to buying this cd) then something decent to go by is this: if you like Thom Yorke's voice (from Radiohead) and the moody tunes that Radiohead puts out... add a little more rock to that and you have Muse.  At least on this cd.  Songs 1-5 on this cd blew my mind
Amazing  If you already own "Frances the Mute" and have truely gotten to know it
Ultimate Millie  This is Millie doing what she does best--telling it like it is. I have been a fan for awhile and she always seems to amaze me. She is definitely an entertainer worth having in your collection. If you think her recordings are something
Fueron lo mï¿½ximo hasta que...  Definitivamente
Be Warned: This Is *NOT* the Beulah You're Thinking Of...  There's only one "Beulah"
Rednecks love him too  Me and my man were cruising for a real romantic night on the town.  We had left our 14 children with their grandfather
Cliff Richard : King of UK music  Cliff Richard is the most sucessfull domestic recoring artist of all-time with over 120 U.K hit singles under his belt
Not Worth $24  The 1 star rating is not for the music (that is perfect) but the price. There are plenty of albums with these tracks on for much cheaper!     
Ugh... No talent whatsoever..  This so-so actress
the cream  hard
Bill Fay where are you?  I brought the now seemingly deleted 'bill fay/time of the last persecution' cd originally put out by seeformiles and wasnt dissapointed.Considering the inner sleeve notes claimed this the only recordings he had done as he dissapeared into obscurity in the 70'simagine my amazement in discovering this rare selection of gems! Bill Fay has a wonderful very english sounding voice and some of the flourishes and incredible lyrics make it hard for me to understand why an artist of this amazing talent was sadly overlooked.His voice isnt for everyone (but that didnt hurt dylan did  it?!) but if you like a voice with genuine passion and character then i fully reccomend this wonderful artist! It's a shame you dont put the audio samples on so other people can hear his music as not everyone rushes out and chances on someone they havent heard of before and as Bill is unfortuantly considered to be pretty much unheard of until you do so i fear that he will still sadly be negelected      
psyclone rangers 2nd album (1994)  this album was produced by Ian caple (tindersticks
Amazing Treatment of Classics  I have been a marginal Genesis fan for some time
This Is What Ears Were Made For  My friends these words come to you from much joyous celebration and wonder
No Excuse  No
Magical Nektar  Though not quite in the same class as "Remember the Future" or "A Tab in the Ocean
i didn't know it was possible to wear out a compact disc  i've loved squeeze from the moment i heard them---their skillfully crafted material
The future is yours to keep!  One of my favorites of all time. I have gone thru numerous lp copies and was burnt by the first cd release. Finally justice is served for this masterpiece. Turn down the lights
"a beautiful, soulful voice""  aretha franklin is the queen of soul, and her big, bouncy voice just soothes me every time. I can not think of one person who's voice is as large as hers - amazing. the two discs are just full of classics. i love them all, but the highlights for me are (in order of places on discs): ""i knew u were waiting"" (UK no. 1/US no. 1)"" ""think"" (UK no. 1/Us no. 2)""(u make me feel like) a natural woman"" (UK no. 1/US no. 1) ""i never loved a man (the way I love u)"" (UK no. 1/US no. 1)""chain of fools"" (UK no. 1/US no. 2)""until u come back to me (that's what i'm gonna do) (UK no. 1/US no. 1)""let it be"" (UK no. 3/US no. 2)and my favourite song on the two discs, ""son of a preacherman"" (UK no. 1/US no. 2), ""sisters are doin' it for themselves"" (UK no. 1/US no. 1) ""ain't no way"" (UK no. 2/US no. 2) ""baby i love u"" (UK no. 3/US no. 7) and ""the long & winding road"" (UK no. 1/US no. 4). thera re many brilliant songs on this classic album. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

AN49COVXNHCYM,B0000246VQ,5.0,Fun, full of variety, and top notch.............  Few albums were released by Al in the eighties, but I am glad that Last Days of the Century came along like a blast of fresh air.  The sound of this collection is unlike any before or after due to the sound of the time.  Yes, it may be a little overproduced, but every producer will give Al a different flavor. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Joe Chicarelli did take Al where I think he wanted to go at the time to try to acheive radio airplay, and it is obvious that radio detractors simply won't give Al the credit he deserves.  The only jarring song on this collection, ""Real and Unreal"" seems out of place here, but it isn't so bad that it doesn't deserve some credit too.  ""Last Days of the Century"
The concept and the music are incompatible.......  I'm not exactly sure what made Al feel impelled to enlist Laurence Juber as the producer of this project
65 Minutes of compilation.  Its a great CD
Holiday Romance was brilliant.  What's with this?  Ska
Mccratney II  The less said the better. Two or three barely passable tunes and the rest should be buried and forgotten. Interesting only for collectors to complete their McCartney collections
Press To Play  One of the unfortunately forgotten McCartney albums. Some clinkers on it
Genious? I don't think so  I have been a huge Byrds fan for years
A disapointment  Considering that this album is Gene Clark's first solo effort after he left the magnificent
Genious? I don't think so  I have been a huge Byrds fan for years
A Rising Star  Josh Groban is undoubtedly the greatest voice of our time.  This first album showcases an incredible depth
I don't see what the craze about this album is...  Maybe I have a different preference of my music than this album. There are a few good songs on here
Quite impressive...  Yes
David Hasselhoff=Prophet  Let me break you off with a little piece of knowledge. The series baywatch was good. No.... Baywatch was great.....amazing......NO. Baywatch is what God really meant when he said "Let there be light". Now that thats out of the way I had the pleasure of treating my ears to this German siren of the compact disc. My expectations were high going in but when I left I had a new appreciation for mullets
Just Plain Fun!!!  You do NOT have to be as old as I am to enjoy this collection!  If you are not singing along with these tunes
End of an Era  Unfortunately
Classic Jimmy Sommerville  Jimmy's ethereal naturally falsetto voice is truly showcased on this album that goes from awesome classic dance tracks to slower ballads.  All with a synth
Beefheart's last stand  It is a shame that the person who made this recording
An outstanding album all around  This album has a range of beautiful sounds from beginning to end
I only have one word: WOW!!  I have been a huge Savage Garden fan since their start in 1997 and when I heard the Darren was going to release a solo album I was so excited! But nothing prepared me for the first track off the album "Insatiable". It has to be the most moving and beautiful words ever sung
Best rock I've heard in a while!  I loved this album from the very first time I heard it. A great collection of songs. I hope this band will get the recognition it honestly deserves.       
It's about time...  Being a fan since the "H to He" days
Don't waste your money  Don't get me wrong
The main track rocks
sweet latin soul  Nice work here
Classic Latin rock  Man this cd is awesome! it is also historical and a pleasure to listen to. If you like latin rock
funky latin soul  This is a great cd with smoking latin funk!! but dang it so hard to get!! If you loved this compilation you will really love "Back to the barrio" - rare and hard to find Chicano classics vol. 1. contact chorizo records. www.chorizomusic2003@yahoo.com    Enjoy!!     
A Must buy for the video alone  Was tipped off about this CD-Single by Chris Carter
Way too good to be forgotten  I first picked up this album in the bargin bin in the 70's with a hole punched in the cover. It was  one of the best albums I ever heard. The music is so well tailored for a get up and go fun experience turning to a sad and yet very true years later
The album that defined the "Gothenburg Sound"...  Yes
