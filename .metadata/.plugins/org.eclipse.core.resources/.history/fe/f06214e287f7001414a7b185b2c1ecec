Heartfelt
Intestine Shaka  I was down on my luck and empty on the bottle when I heard the screeching ape squeels of Darwin Harcklefarber oozing from ten foot speakers in a local ghetto for the first time. I ordered it from Amazon that afternoon
Great Jazz
Another UNKLE classic  If you like creative beats and eclectic breaks   this is for you.     
 Opening the doors for melodic death metal...   Always  was an album truly before its time.   Released in 1993 
Even 22 Years Later
A Real Disappointment  After really enjoying the Amici Forever album
TY for the suggestion to buy from amazon.uk   I love this 2 cd set
Nirvana ripped them off  If you buy this album
...my review pt.2  let me just add to my review below
very good listen  overall NIN
some of the BEST MUSIC you could ever buy  i;m relatively new to the coil listening experience. (thats what it is)   an experience. yet
Very good  Hey This is a really good prog band. Maybe the best in Europe. 1 star? You;re just kidding Pablo.     
Unconditionally Guaranteed  This is a really good album. Some say that this is the worst album of Beefheart
Good for techno fans
 Music to my ears  If you were disappointed by Darude;s  Before The Storm  album and want to find better songs from him 
An underlooked DJ  Tomcraft is an often underlooked DJ. According to DJ Mag
This song is a classic  If you have ever been to a club before
Give it a chance  This is the first song that I have listened to from Angel City. It;s an interesting one with catchy tunes. I;m not familar with Angel City or Lara Mcallen
Can you say Jigga Jigga?  If you;re not familiar with techno
