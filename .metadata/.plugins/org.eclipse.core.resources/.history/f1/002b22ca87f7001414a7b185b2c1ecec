the most manufactured piece of rubbish anyware in the world  god I hate this album and every song on it. I hate westlife and their simpering boyband plastic pop pap. In Britian
Lou Reed is God  I started out a velvets purist.  I guess all the leather and the CHP glasses gave me an incorrect impression of his solo stuff.  Golly Gee I was wrong.  Not the first time.  These 3 cd;s are mandatory (these are the only ones I have).  After a few listens I started to get it and gradually fell in love with the cleverness and charm of these musical gems.  Lou is life.  a mass of contradictions.  mainstream and not so mainstream.  clean and out of his mind. humble and conceited.  He;s throwing it out there for real? or is it tonguencheek?  or does it fluctuate?  constantly eluding himself? full circle and back again and still untouchable.  take it for what it is. impossible to pin and beyond categorization.  One of the all time greatest cds for hangovers as well.       
NOT a soundtrack   save your money if that;s what you want....  I don;t know what this is
just awesome  this is one of my favorite songs.i absolutely love it i suggest to get the complete album. i am pretty sure you won;t regret it.     
nice.   A lot of people say Marion Raven is working the same formula as Avril Lavigne and Kelly Clarkson used
Kiki Dee   Elton John at their Best  I do not have either this CD (Amoureuse) or the original LP in my collection+ADs- but I do have the LP
Found it 15 Years Later  I have been searching for Accepts Staying a Life 2CD set for the last 15 years Unlike the American version the German Import is much better and has an additional 4 tracks on it. The additional songs that are missing from the American release are: Head Over Heels Burning Neon Nights Outro (Bound to Fail) Also the American version is not a 2 CD set. If you are a hardcore Accept fan
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE   Like so many others
Fela rises up on the west coast  This Boxed CD set contains many of the Great Fela songs
Songs from the collective consciousness  Great music.  Go beyond the surface
Finally  This is Sadao Watanabe at his finest  Backed by a superb group of all star backup musicians such as Eric Gale and Steve Gadd
Ruggiero Ricci at his absolute best   We all should be fortunate that Ruggiero Ricci is a prolific recording artist and that every stage of his career is on disc. These 1952
Third Volume of the Legend of Dance Music Series Highlighting Larry Levan;s Paradise Garage(This is an import released in Japan)    For some reason none of the websites that sell this CD have the tracklist
Something to listen to while sitting on a very different park bench  Let me get this through to you as soon as possible+ADs- This is not your (insert relative here);s Aqualung LP. This is not your Aqualung CD. If you really must know
 The Human League CRASHED literally on this one  It is hard to believe that the band that brought us such masterpieces as  Being Boiled  
Great group of CD;s  I always give MOS a chance when it comes to their CD compilations
Superb   Like Freddy And The Dreamers of the 60;s  This is a fantastic album.  Very upbeat with hidden dark passages...much like Freddy And The Dreamers of the 1960;s.  This is a great album to listen to time and time again....it sounds different each time I play it.  Beautiful and very soft and mello.  Cuckoo ForCeltic     
Too Great of An Album
BREATH TAKING   This CD has left me speechless  It was such a pleasant surprise and I have been hooked since my first listen.  I;m a H U G E Meshell fan
