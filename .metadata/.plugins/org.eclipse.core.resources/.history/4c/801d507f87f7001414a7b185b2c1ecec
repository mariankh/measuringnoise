80;s High Tech with Rock Emotion  Although all of Mr Hines work is high quality
A combination of all Oldfields ingrediants and talents.  I thought
top  3 trance songs of all time  Yes
mislabeled..but this cd is on fire   Yes
worth the price  Ive recenlty become enamored to the AVB sound that has become pure ear candy.   After hearing his 004 Transparance and some of remixes
perfectly orchestrated album  This double album was definitely worth the price. The first album has some beautiful melodies. The first track is a good one to start out with. The second track is the beautiful melodic Way OUt West Mindcircus. From there
Finally his journey has started  My opinions might be subjective since I like Tarkan a lot and I am Turkish.  I believe Tarkan is the best Turkish singer in Turkey  ...  and he is one of the best in the world
 .   i had just introduced one of my friends to hikki and was complaining to him that she hadnt come out with anything since end of 2002. so i took a trip to her website and saw the announcement for her new single. after the disappointment of exodus
and i wish it wish it could have been better...  I had big expectations for this CD.  After ;Eternal Nightcap;
Fine debut Solo album from former LRB lead singer.  This record was made almost immeadiatly after Glenn left LRB in early 1982. The album was produced by John Boylan who had produced the LRB albums Diamantina Cocktail
A Definite Step Back  Maybe I was expecting way too much.  I would easily give EOE and NFB 5 stars each.  This album is just way too bland.  Even the hooks don;t get me.  Hard to explain   it;s just very average
One of Bolan;s best.   I bought this cd thinking it would have a few decent songs after reading the reviews
get this one  Get THIS cd cover (white
 Best track isn;t even on the album  I bought this album the day it came out in the U.S. with high hopes after loving  Back To The Egg .  Boy oh boy 
Very good album
 great song  ok ok i;ve only heard one Powderfinger song which is called  Grave Concern . It was on a muti artist disc put out  in 1994 by  Kahlua liquor and Juice magazine.This is one of the most powerfully sonic songs i have ever heard.Crank up your speakers and run the cats  
This is not Planet P  Beware
listen here...  please don;t listen to some of the other reviews of this album who say its boring or too long.if you are mature enough to appreciate good musicianship and good melody than this is a must buy.the 22 minute track is how they did it sometimes in those days and its refreshing in this day and age to hear.it rocks.it is easy going at times but still very enjoyable.     
A proper reveiw on Nightwish for a change.  THIS ALBUM SUCKS. ANYBODY SUCKERING YOU INTO BUYING IT SUCKS.  ANYBODY THAT GIVES THIS MORE THAN 1 STAR SUCKS.  TO SOME UP
Misleading Title  After purchasing this CD I was 
Rednecks love him too  Me and my man were cruising for a real romantic night on the town.  We had left our 14 children with their grandfather
