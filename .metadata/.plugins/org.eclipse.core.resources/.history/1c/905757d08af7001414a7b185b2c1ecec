Not Worth 24  The 1 star rating is not for the music (that is perfect) but the price. There are plenty of albums with these tracks on for much cheaper  
Ugh... No talent whatsoever..  This soso actress
Bill Fay where are you?  I brought the now seemingly deleted bill fay/time of the last persecution cd originally put out by seeformiles and wasnt dissapointed.Considering the inner sleeve notes claimed this the only recordings he had done as he dissapeared into obscurity in the 70simagine my amazement in discovering this rare selection of gems Bill Fay has a wonderful very english sounding voice and some of the flourishes and incredible lyrics make it hard for me to understand why an artist of this amazing talent was sadly overlooked.His voice isnt for everyone (but that didnt hurt dylan did  it?) but if you like a voice with genuine passion and character then i fully reccomend this wonderful artist Its a shame you dont put the audio samples on so other people can hear his music as not everyone rushes out and chances on someone they havent heard of before and as Bill is unfortuantly considered to be pretty much unheard of until you do so i fear that he will still sadly be negelected      
psyclone rangers 2nd album (1994)  this album was produced by Ian caple (tindersticks
Amazing Treatment of Classics  I have been a marginal Genesis fan for some time
This Is What Ears Were Made For  My friends these words come to you from much joyous celebration and wonder
Magical Nektar  Though not quite in the same class as Remember the Future or A Tab in the Ocean
Surprisingly effective  Hawkwind is in surprisingly good form on this late 80s release. Though by no means comprable to the groups glory period
Nektars best?  Possibly its sure close to being their best. Bought this one way back in the mid seventies shortly after it came out and still like it quite a bit. Roye Albrightons hot guitar is all over this one and the whole disc achieves a kind of ambient calm thats lacking on other Nektar records. Unlike some of the other reviewers
Neuroniums best psychotronic work  Though not nearly as well known as some of their German or French counterparts (Tangerine Dream
Killer KrautRock  Devastating record from this second generation krautrocker
Done Right  Perhaps Cab Volts best allaround work. Certainly
No agitation  Agitation Frees name typifies this entire record. From the opening track
Dawn of the Transistor Children  Amon Duul IIs third album is one of the best psychedelic freakouts youll ever hear in my opinion
Not Worth 24  The 1 star rating is not for the music (that is perfect) but the price. There are plenty of albums with these tracks on for much cheaper  
A masterpiece  finally out of the woodwork  During the couple of months prior to this album finally being released
mellow  This song has got it just right. The right tone
Great Song  Got to admit
Seriously Underated  Its quite a shame that the majority of this genre of music is so often compared to the likes of Coldplay. As brilliant as Coldplay are
Amazing  This song has to be one of my all time favourites and Im not even much of a Keane fan. First time I heard this song on the radio
Best Emotional Song Of 2004  Not only did this song play a part in rekindling a relationship with my then ex girlfriend
Legends  Not moving away from their distinct originality that makes them one of the best rock bands around today
Dynamite comes in small packeges  Being a fan for years
Great Album  I heard the song The Sparrows And The Nightingales in a club in Israel and well
Much better than its been rated.  This album was seen as a huge disappointment by many fans
My favorite...  I have this album
Excellent Bsides  If youre reading this
cmon  Okay. This is probably the worst Suede release yet. But this is really a soft rock album. If you like Suede for their harder leanings
Ashanti  All I can say is Ashanti did her thing in this video. This video really shows that she has grown up alot. I really like this video and when the CD come out Im gonna go and get it. I hope it is as good as the first.     
Aaliyah  This C.D is off the chain. I had seen this single when it first came out. I knew it was good because all of her music is off the chain. The one thing I like about her is that she keeps it real and tells the truth about everything. If u doesnt have this C.D then u should go out and get it.

Evolution Breakdown  Ive been a hardcore Tea Party fan for about seven years now. I even met them back in 1999. First of all Id like to say that they are extremely underrated. They are one of the best Canadian bands ever Mainly because of their unique sound. They are down to earth guys with a knack for music. All of their albums are unique for their own reasons. With Interzone Mantras I found it to be unexpected. Jeff Martin stated a few times back in 2001 that they were going to kick things into high gear and the only thing I can see in that is possibly the quick pace of the songs on this cd. I admit I was a bit dissappointed in this album. Its difficult today to keep music fresh because music evolves so much and you get caught up in the sounds of today. I however was expecting more eastern sounding instruments like on Edges Of Twighlight. They had a few but it doesnt even near in comparison. I find the songs to be all connected which is good but they sound very similar and there isnt a lot of variety on this album. But hey
Radio John Found...  I had several conversations with John Hartford concerning Radio John and where the tapes may have ended up
EXPISTOLS  GET IN THE RING LAND KNOCKOUT IN ONE GREAT CD  Youre Steve Jones or Paul Cook and The Sex Pistols fizzle..what do you do for act 2?? This is a great lost album of 1981. I lost the vinyl in a fire years ago
Pretty impressed...  I was positively impressed last night when I got my Eddies Head.  Its not that Limited Edition since 25
Lo Borges finally stands out  With A Via L ctea
Pery Ribeiro  Bossa Tr s   Swinging
Nothing new under the sun  Despite being a Nicola Contes fan I think that his new album for Blue Note is a pretentious attempt to switch from the fresh sound of the previous albums to a boring excercise of rereading the glorious sound of the jazz of the fifties and sixties. It doesnt sound new and fresh at all (apart from Kind of sunshine very much in the St.Germain style). What saves this album is the quality of the musicians that took part to it and the fact that the tracks that originally inspired Nicola Contes ones are so good that any copy cant be that bad. But next time I expect a change of direction...again.     
2 worthwhile songs  Im a big fan of ABBA and the vocal harmonies of the two women
40 Blue Fingers  Formed in 1967
Debbies Wig  Japanese pressing of the 1982 album has been digitally remastered with 1 bonus track and comes packaged in a miniature LP sleeve. Virgin. 2006.  The more I listen to this album the more I love It. Its full of very good pop songs: Danceway
Wow  This LP proves that Blondie is a major pop band Their best LP since Parallel Lines
The End Of Everything  Thanks For The Ride  I found this album in the used bin of my neighborhood record shop and it has become

Peculiar but excellent  What an album  After the lame mess of Back to the Egg
All About The Sander Mix   Amazing Remix By Sander Kleinenberg. This is the only cd to find this track other than the vinyl which is sold out probably in every record shop. Defenitely a floorkiller.     
Defining Moments  I know its generally held that SMOKIN was the Pie at their peak but

 Superb British Psychedelia    I got a recommendation for this 
one of the best albums of 2002  This synth pop trio keep on getting better with every release. this album is their best so far ( a new album should be out soon ... ) 
Wow  Expensive and worth it. I cant believe this wasnt worthy of domestic distribution.     
Cashin.  First of all
Beware: COPYPROTECTED  My honest impression
American dream  I used to be an Iraqi insurgent but after attacking and blowing up the lastest road block I stumbled upon what I can only describe as nirvana  David alHaselhoffs greatest hits. Why oh why was this walking god amongst men not sent to us before? When I played it on a looted stereo I was instantly struck by the melodies that could only have been sent to earth by angels
La Lear Queen of Eurodisco  A good compilation featuring Ms Lears late 1980s under rated album Secret Passion tracks from her 90s albums Cadavre Exquise
The Greatest Album Ever Released   This is my current desert island album. Its a classic. Its better than OK computer
Want some Records?  Start with this one.  The Records debut has been a favorite of mine ever since I bought the vinyl album in 1979.  I have always loved power pop
Why change perfection?  The Sherman brothers (who wrote all of the songs for the film)are still alive. As a matter of fact
Red Hot Guitar Shredding  I can still remember the first time I heard this album 20 years ago. I was turned on to Link Wrays  Bullshot  by Bo Solomon
HOW BEAUTIFUL
i didnt know it was possible to wear out a compact disc  ive loved squeeze from the moment i heard them their skillfully crafted material
Awesome C.D.not just for SM fans but for all anime fans   This is really a great cd and i was excited when i first got a chance to listen to it.   The tracks are: 1.  Sailor Star Song  very nice
Classic  I dont know why this hasnt been released in the US yet but for you lot across the water i can reveal that its a damn classic  Its truly the record that this band have been building towards over the last few years and they just seem to get better and better.Mostly acoustic 
Secret Treasure  This was the fifth album from Glasgows secret treasure.Not enough people have heard of this band which is a damn shame because 
Glasgows Greatest  Another work of genius from the greatest band youve never heard of.Slow
wonderful  This live recording of some of the best loved Flanders and Swann songs is truly a transport of delight   
this is a terrible album   charlotte church has an honest talent. so why is she succombing to the same advertising ploys as britney spears and lindsay lohan? parading around like a sex toy
THE BEST CONCEPT ALBUM EVER  Those familiar with Savatage may proceed to the next paragraph. All others may find useful to know that Savatage although under the wider umbrella of heavy metal
Extraordinary journey  Cant say enough about this album  Some New Age music lacks soul without vocals
Robbie captured my heart  I love Robbie Williams  hes like a hit machine i was only semi interested in him for the longest time
This Sad Pletnev Story  I have to respectfully disagree with the other two gentlemen who left rather excited reviews
Not Yet Heard It  As I have not yet heard this album
A MustListen Album  I strongly recommend this album
It makes me love myself  Women are sweet
Open your heart to Russian Music  I received From Russia with Love as a gift from Switzerland in the mail. After listening to the music I immediately checked out the web site from Helmut Lotti and was stunned to learn that Helmut is not a Russian. Listening to his music in From Russia with Love
BARRY WILLIAMS SHOW   JERRY SPRINGER  THIS SONG IS SO FUNNY I COULD HARDLY DRIVE WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT. IT POKES FUN AT AMERICAN AND UK TABLOID TV LIKE JERRY TRASH SPRINGER.

Great song.......  Someday is a good song
enjoy your rain shower  Tex Perkins finds a groove in this mellow acoustic album which displays his vocal talents very well.  The once lead singer for The Cruel Sea
Quite Good (for any Coldplay fan)  I am a big Coldplay fan
Jeg elsker Deg Lene-  I am a huge music fan who is always searching for something new and beautiful. From time to time I experience musical revolutions that sweep over my mind and conquer my heart. But these raging storms of soul are every rare. This first album from this young beautiful Norwegian girl is a solemn vulcano. I only heard Sitting down here in Hungary
Tropicalia  This is still one of my favourite Beck singles its just an amazing song. Taken from the album Mutations
Excellent all except...  I loved the original song
Amazing...such a talented actress AND singer  I agree 100+ACU-
