Tips
for
staying
at
the
Ocean
Blue
Our
family
of
five
had
a
nice
time
at
Ocean
Blue
it
was
beautiful
!
Here
are
some
tips
that
I
hope
will
be
helpful
.
1
.
The
rooms
are
dim
I
took
a
light
bulb
but
could
have
used
more
than
one
.2
.
We
booked
two
rooms
they
put
us
on
the
second
floor
the
kids
on
the
third
floor
.
We
heard
several
people
complain
about
this
.
-LRB-
The
kids
had
a
great
time
being
away
from
us
-RRB-
3
.
Be
sure
to
tip
the
maid
.
I
forgot
one
day
because
we
were
in
a
hurry
and
we
only
got
one
clean
towel
and
the
fridge
was
not
restocked
.4
.
When
you
check
out
-
don
&#039;
t
leave
your
keys
in
the
room
.
I
did
and
the
check
out
clerk
was
not
happy
.
It
was
the
only
time
an
employee
was
rude
to
me
.5
.
I
took
a
cheap
air
mattress
for
the
pool
.
We
enjoyed
using
it
.
Left
it
there
when
we
left
.6
.
When
the
locals
came
on
Friday
to
sell
items
I
bought
something
and
they
acted
like
they
could
not
give
me
change
.
My
husband
came
up
and
demanded
my
change
.
They
quickly
pulled
it
out
of
their
pocket
.7
.
After
7
days
we
were
tired
of
the
food
.
At
times
we
would
be
finished
eating
before
we
got
our
drinks
.
I
started
taking
my
soda
with
me
out
of
the
fridge
from
our
room
.8
.
The
safari
tour
was
educational
and
fun
.9
.
The
massages
were
wonderful
.10
.
We
never
got
a
plug
for
our
tub
after
calling
several
times
for
one
.11
.
We
were
always
too
tired
to
go
to
the
shows
they
don
&#039;
t
start
until
9:30
in
the
evening
and
it
gets
dark
around
7:00.12
.
The
photo
shop
takes
great
pictures
.
Book
an
appointment
when
you
get
there
.
They
are
not
cheap
but
I
got
20
awesome
family
pictures
of
us
on
the
beach
.
Everybody
wearing
white
shirts
looks
really
nice
.
They
only
take
cash
.13
.
The
sun
rises
around
5:30
and
it
is
beautiful
to
watch
on
the
beach
.
We
were
the
only
ones
out
there
and
I
felt
safe
because
the
security
men
were
on
duty
.14
.
Mikes
Coffee
Shop
was
so
good
.
We
also
really
liked
the
ice
cream
at
all
of
the
buffets.Overall
this
was
a
nice
place
.
I
don
&#039;
t
think
I
would
stay
there
again
because
I
like
to
go
to
new
places
.
Great
Hotel
Located
in
Mong
Kok
as
soon
as
you
step
outside
the
Langham
Place
you
are
in
the
middle
of
the
real
HK
-
and
also
the
most
densely
populated
area
.
It
&#039;
s
an
unusual
location
for
a
5
*
but
it
&#039;
s
a
weel
serviced
hotel
with
very
high
standards
-
and
I
mean
high
!
If
you
don
&#039;
tlike
heights
don
&#039;
t
go
here
-
there
lifts
are
scenic
-LRB-
although
a
couple
are
enclosed
-RRB-
and
the
swimming
pool
on
the
42nd
floor
treadmills
face
the
view
from
the
41st
.
It
&#039;
s
a
good
half
hour
walk
from
the
harbour
front
and
in
a
busy
place
like
this
that
&#039;
s
not
easy
.
however
MRT
is
just
outside
the
Langham
Place
mall
-LRB-
connected
to
the
hotel
-RRB-
and
is
so
efficient
you
are
anywhere
in
a
few
minutes
.
So
all
the
sights
are
within
easy
reach
.
Concierge
are
very
obliging
and
despite
other
comments
on
the
site
there
is
no
need
to
bribe
them
with
big
tips
.
Hotel
breakfast
is
excellent
-LRB-
but
shouldbe
at
the
price
-RRB-
and
the
Ming
Court
chinese
is
very
good
indeed.Wonderful
beds
and
pillows
and
glass
wall
in
the
bathroom
mean
you
can
watch
the
plasma
TV
from
the
bath
and
watch
you
other
half
have
a
--
while
you
lie
on
the
bed
!
well
there
is
a
blind
you
can
pull
...
Don
&#039;
t
miss
out
on
MongKok
though
it
&#039;
s
a
fascinating
area
of
HK
that
you
might
not
visit
unless
staying
at
this
hotel
.
Never
again
We
had
flown
into
Seattle
June
21
to
catch
the
following
day
Alaska
cruise
departing
from
downtown
.
Yes
we
stayed
here
that
Thursday
June
21
2007
This
hotel
is
old
and
the
AC
was
not
working
.
The
room
was
sealed
up
all
day
and
it
was
stifling
hot
.
The
only
thing
we
could
do
to
cool
the
room
down
was
to
open
the
small
window
.
I
complained
to
the
front
desk
several
times
and
the
best
they
could
do
was
to
loan
me
their
small
desk
fan
to
put
by
the
window
.
Their
advice
was
to
leave
the
bathroom
fan
going
all
night
with
the
window
open
.
Hopefully
I
might
get
some
cross
ventilation
.
I
must
say
I
never
thought
of
that
.
-LRB-
Who
thinks
of
stuff
like
that
???
-RRB-
Why
don
&#039;
t
they
just
fix
the
AC
system
?
I
was
so
hot
I
could
not
sleep
so
I
went
downstairs
to
get
something
cool
to
drink
at
their
restaurant
only
to
find
their
restaurant
is
closed
due
to
renovations
.
It
was
a
miserable
night
for
my
family
and
me
.
I
guess
the
cruise
made
up
for
it
.
To
be
fair
the
staff
was
nice
but
how
do
you
make
up
for
such
poor
facilities
???
If
you
stay
here
I
hope
you
fair
better
.
Thanks
for
reading
.
Bleh
what
a
disappointment
.
.
My
husband
and
I
stayed
here
for
a
quick
trip
to
NOLA
and
regretted
it
greatly
.
It
was
noisy
and
dirty
and
small
and
nasty
.
You
see
these
two
beautiful
pictures
on
most
sites
of
it
&#039;
s
beautiful
courtyard
well
that
&#039;
s
about
the
extent
of
it
&#039;
s
beauty
I
can
promise
you
that
.
Add
to
the
price
of
the
room
about
$
35
in
fees
and
you
have
the
actual
price
of
the
room
.
They
reel
people
in
with
their
cheap
price
then
tack
on
a
crapload
of
random
charges
at
the
end
to
push
the
price
up
.
Parking
?
FORGET
IT
.
They
don
&#039;
t
voucher
and
the
closest
parking
is
across
the
street
in
a
lot
for
$
20/day
.
I
will
never
ever
stay
here
again
.
Besides
I
don
&#039;
t
think
it
will
be
standing
much
longer
from
the
looks
of
it
it
is
about
to
fall
down
.
Good
location
I
think
the
hotel
disappointed
us
because
of
all
the
good
reviews
.
Also
a
lesson
-
we
should
have
told
them
it
was
my
birthday
-LRB-
which
it
was
-RRB-
.
In
contrast
to
other
reviews
there
was
no
wine/champagne
in
the
room
and
our
bedtime
treat
was
strictly
a
bottle
of
evian
-
not
a
single
chocolate
the
whole
stay
!
The
bed
was
comfortable
-LRB-
very
similar
to
the
Malmaison
chain
in
the
UK
-RRB-
and
the
location
was
excellent
.
However
I
didn
&#039;
t
find
the
room
-LRB-
admittedly
a
lower
floor
-RRB-
was
any
better
or
worse
bigger
or
smaller
than
any
other
good
4-star
city
centre
hotel
.
I
&#039;
m
glad
it
was
a
short
stay
as
there
was
very
little
clothes
storage
.
I
also
thought
that
there
was
a
lack
of
information
in
our
room-only
on
the
last
day
did
I
discover
the
internet
access
in
the
reception
area
.
It
was
a
busy
time
-LRB-
Thanksgiving
-RRB-
and
when
contact
with
staff
was
neccessary
such
as
check-in
they
were
polite
and
friendly
but
I
didn
&#039;
t
really
feel
particularly
welcomed
into
the
hotel
.
I
would
have
no
hesitation
in
staying
there
again
but
it
is
a
good
city
4
star
-LRB-
not
5
star
-RRB-
hotel
and
please
don
&#039;
t
be
disappointed
by
the
fact
that
some
reviews
might
indicate
otherwise
.
Post
Holiday
Blues
were
gone
upon
our
arrival
at
this
lovely
hotel
.
Our
stay
was
from
Dec
26th-29th
.
Great
service
our
luggage
didn
&#039;
t
make
it
but
was
delivered
to
our
room
the
next
morning
--
airline
problems
.
Barry
made
reservations
with
excellent
suggestions
went
out
of
his
way
to
update
us
of
any
changes
.
Our
room
was
clean
well
adorned
with
a
balcony
no
noise
from
outside
or
inside
and
the
price
was
outstanding
.
Much
better
than
previous
4
star
lodgings
at
twice
the
rate
.
Ate
buffet
breakfast
3
mornings
--
very
good
and
convient
.
Would
highly
recommend
.
Leonor
is
a
true
ambassador
!
This
was
my
Mother
&#039;
s
first
trip
to
Hawaii
.
We
selected
the
Hotel
Renew
based
on
tripadvisor.com
comments
.
All
the
wonderful
comments
regarding
Leonor
are
accurate
.
The
hotel
is
nicely
located
the
rooms
are
comfortable
and
clean
-LRB-
we
stayed
in
one
of
the
newly
remodeled
rooms
-RRB-
and
the
continental
breakfast
included
fresh
coffee
juices
and
plenty
of
fresh
pastries
toast
and
fresh
fruit
.
While
everyone
was
warm
friendly
and
helpful
Leonor
was
amazing
.
She
made
us
feel
as
though
we
were
family
.
She
went
above
and
beyond
in
ensuring
my
Mother
I
were
comfortable
and
enjoying
our
stay
.
When
she
learned
we
were
leaving
early
-LRB-
5:00
am
-RRB-
for
our
flight
she
arranged
to
have
pastries
and
fresh
fruit
delivered
to
our
room
the
evening
prior
to
our
departure
which
we
both
appreciated
very
much
.
It
was
a
wonderful
trip
.
I
wanted
to
ensure
my
Mother
who
is
78
had
a
great
trip
and
Leonor
and
hotel
renew
were
integral
to
ensuring
it
was
a
success
!
Thank
you
!
Great
value
but
some
poky
rooms
The
deal
they
offered
me
--
EUR55
a
night
for
a
single
en
suite
room
including
breakfast
and
taxes
--
was
excellent
value
given
the
location
--
it
&#039;
s
at
the
northern
end
of
La
Rambla
literally
a
few
doors
down
from
Pla?a
de
Catalunya
with
its
local
train
and
metro
station
and
its
bus
stops
for
the
airport
sightseeing
and
several
local
buses
.
The
location
also
places
the
hotel
within
easy
walking
distance
of
both
the
historic
heart
of
the
old
city
and
the
later
Eixample
with
its
celebrated
Moderniste
architecture
.
The
first
floor
room
was
small
and
basic
but
clean
and
comfortable
--
the
catch
was
that
there
was
no
natural
light
with
only
a
small
window
looking
out
onto
a
gloomy
ventilation
well
.
Fine
if
you
&#039;
re
out
all
the
time
and
only
need
a
base
to
dump
luggage
shower
and
sleep
but
not
a
place
to
hang
out
during
the
day
.
Breakfast
was
standard
self
service
cereals
bread
jam
and
simple
pastries
though
with
fresh
fruit
and
yoghurt
too
.
The
multilingual
staff
on
the
24-hour
reception
are
friendly
and
helpful
but
as
I
found
when
I
met
up
with
a
friend
based
in
Barcelona
they
take
a
dim
view
of
visitors
in
the
rooms
.
Great
Hotel
for
location
and
food
but
lacking
in
room
quality
and
decor
We
just
returned
from
a
nine
day
stay
at
the
Waikiki
Beach
Marriott
Hotel
.
I
give
a
tip
of
the
hat
to
the
front
desk
clerks
and
the
housekeeping
staff
...
they
were
really
good
.
The
open
air
theme
of
the
hotel
lobby
floor
was
a
truly
refreshing
reminder
that
we
were
in
Hawaii.The
food
in
the
Kuhio
Grill
was
superb
...
we
had
9
breakfasts
there
and
3
buffet
dinners
and
the
food
and
the
service
was
superb
.
You
were
never
rushed
and
there
never
seemed
to
be
line-ups
.
Elevators
worked
terrific
no
problems
there.Being
right
across
the
road
from
the
beach
was
really
delightful
and
all
the
shops
were
so
close
by.Now
for
the
down
side
.
We
stayed
in
a
Deluxe
Oceanfront
room
which
was
really
great
.
just
that
we
expected
more
quality
from
a
Marriott
Hotel
.
The
room
was
quite
sparesely
furnished
with
a
small
clothes
cupboard
with
ancient
louvered
doors
and
6
coat
hangers
.
There
were
2
small
drawers
in
the
TV
cupboard
to
store
all
the
rest
of
our
belongings
.
Luggage
was
barely
able
to
be
stored
in
the
closet
.
We
had
2
chairs
and
a
writing
desk
and
a
small
round
table
.
The
bathroom
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
.
They
have
replaced
the
taps
and
faucets
...
...
but
the
bathtub
has
been
cleaned
so
much
that
it
is
down
below
the
enamel
and
it
did
not
drain
so
you
were
standing
in
3
inches
of
water
while
showering
.
I
hated
even
standing
in
it
to
shower
.
The
tub
and
toilet
are
in
a
small
cramped
room
with
a
door
and
the
basin
and
mirror
are
located
just
outside
.
Again
an
old
sink
that
should
have
been
replaced
years
ago.Other
that
that
our
stay
in
Hawaii
was
really
great
.
Next
time
we
come
we
are
planning
on
checking
out
a
Condo
as
you
really
do
not
spend
that
much
time
in
the
Hotel
but
when
you
do
you
want
the
quality
you
paid
for
in
the
surroundings
.
Great
value
great
location
tiny
room
My
husband
and
I
stayed
at
the
Hotel
Triton
for
three
nights
as
part
of
our
trip
down
the
coast
of
California
.
We
chose
this
hotel
because
of
its
affordability
and
great
location
and
we
were
not
disappointed.Our
check-in
was
fast
and
easy
and
the
helpful
staff
gave
us
maps
and
directions
to
some
fabulous
locations
in
San
Francisco
.
The
lobby
was
small
but
cute
and
we
enjoyed
their
afternoon
wine
and
cookies
.
There
was
also
a
tarot
card
reader
available
but
we
did
not
use
her
services.Our
room
was
tiny
but
we
expected
that
for
the
price
and
location
.
The
tv
was
nice
and
the
bed
was
extremely
comfortable
.
The
bathroom
was
small
but
adequate
.
Everything
was
clean
and
comfortable
.
We
didn
&#039;
t
spend
much
time
in
our
room
because
there
is
so
much
to
do
in
San
Francisco
but
the
time
we
did
spend
there
was
fine.We
also
loved
that
there
was
a
Starbucks
across
the
street
and
the
gate
to
Chinatown
at
the
hotel
&#039;
s
doorstep
.
The
location
of
this
hotel
absolutely
can
&#039;
t
be
beat
.
We
were
able
to
walk
to
everything
we
wanted
to
see
from
the
piers
to
Chinatown
to
Ghiradelli
Square
.
I
would
definitely
recommend
this
hotel
as
long
as
you
don
&#039;
t
plan
on
spending
a
lot
of
time
in
the
room
.
Overall
Good
some
negative
points
I
like
the
hotel
very
much
but
a
few
negatives
were
experienced
.
Positive
first
:
New
amenities
stand
up
shower
conveniently
placed
mirrors
great
bed
hidden
washer
and
dryer
.
Great
pools
and
gym
area
very
convenient
.
They
will
drive
you
around
town
in
their
Bentleys
if
your
going
out
plus
the
driver
can
get
you
into
clubs
-LRB-
Ultra
West
-RRB-
I
forgot
his
name
already
though
.
Some
negatives
:
Food
at
the
bar
and
roomservice
seemed
average
poor
selection
salty
burger
.
There
is
not
a
functioning
restaurant
though
they
are
working
on
it
and
when
done
will
look
great
.
I
had
asked
to
be
moved
to
a
larger
suite
with
a
better
view
of
the
CN
Tower
they
could
not
accomodate
me
and
didnt
follow
up
on
the
following
days
to
see
if
I
would
still
like
to
move
why
not
make
such
requests
a
priority
if
at
all
possible
?
The
suite
itself
I
felt
was
small
I
had
stayed
at
the
Hilton
and
Sheraton
previously
and
had
really
really
large
rooms
for
under
$
80US
.
If
you
would
like
to
try
this
place
for
$
129Cn
you
wont
have
a
bad
experience
but
I
think
my
favorite
is
still
the
Hilton
large
rooms
great
restaurant
.
As
Promised
!
My
family
thoroughly
enjoyed
our
2
nights
here
the
first
week
of
January
.
We
were
worried
the
hotel
might
be
crowded
since
there
is
no
school
the
first
week
of
the
year
due
to
the
3
Kings
Day
holiday
.
It
was
very
quiet
Wed
and
Thr
and
started
filling
up
on
Friday.The
hotel
was
as
promised
.
Great
pool
beach
and
very
clean
rooms
.
The
fact
that
the
rooms
are
all
ocean
view
was
a
nice
surprise
!
We
would
have
liked
a
coffee
maker
in
the
room
but
housekeeping
did
give
us
one
when
asked
-LRB-
they
only
seem
to
have
a
few
-RRB-
.
The
A/C
smelled
musty
and
toiletries
in
the
bathroom
would
have
been
nice
.
All
minor
complaints
but
they
would
have
been
major
had
we
paid
a
rate
of
$
250
nt.This
hotel
would
be
a
$
250
per
night
value
in
San
Juan
but
I
wouldn
&#039;
t
want
to
pay
over
$
150
due
to
the
distance
from
San
Juan
.
Tip
:
You
aren
&#039;
t
allowed
to
bring
coolers
onto
the
resort
grounds
but
there
are
refrigerators
in
the
rooms
.
If
you
have
clear
plastic
cups
you
can
pop
up
to
the
room
for
a
cheaper
refill
of
your
favorite
beverage
vs.
paying
the
poolside
bar
prices
.
Relax
and
Enjoy
My
husband
and
I
stayed
at
this
resort
Feb
3
-
17th
and
did
exactly
what
we
set
out
to
do
-
sit
on
the
beach
and
soak
up
the
sun
.
The
room
was
very
nice
and
comfortable
-LRB-
bldg.
.
L
3rd
floor
-RRB-
with
a
magnificent
view
of
the
ocean
from
our
balcony
.
The
buffet
restaurant
had
a
wide
variety
of
food
choices
and
serving
staff
paid
a
lot
of
attention
to
all
the
guests
.
We
did
not
like
the
Steakhouse-beef
very
tough-otherwise
would
give
the
food
a
good
overall
rating
.
I
would
recommend
heading
out
to
the
beach
to
reserve
a
Reclining
lounger
on
your
way
to
breakfast
otherwise
you
may
have
to
settle
for
one
that
does
not
recline
.
You
can
take
lovely
long
walks
on
the
beach
on
either
side
of
the
resort
and
cool
off
in
the
ocean
along
the
way
.
Take
an
insulated
mug
for
your
beach
beverages

The
common
sitting
area
in
the
Lounge
is
a
great
place
to
relax
sip
drinks
and
meet
people
from
all
over
the
world
.
We
discovered
that
this
resort
is
on
the
Atlantic
side
and
therefore
the
water
is
rougher
and
more
wind
than
on
the
Caribbean
side
.
We
walked
down
to
Secrets
resort
and
you
could
not
even
go
into
the
ocean
there-huge
waves
.
If
you
are
a
&#039;
pool
&#039;
person
you
will
fall
in
love
with
the
breathtaking
pool
area
at
this
resort
.
All
and
all
We
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend
this
place
to
our
friends
.
Excellent
Stayed
three
nights
during
Christmas

I
will
never

The

Don
&#039;
t
stay
anywhere
else
in
Barcelona
!
We
stayed
at
the
marvelous
NH
Duc
de
la
Victoria
in
Barcelona
for
a
four-day
vacation
and
I
can
not
say
enough
positive
things
about
it
.
My
two
main
qualifications
in
chosing
a
hotel
are
location
and
noise
level
and
it
is
often
difficult
to
find
a
quiet
hotel
near
the
sights
.
Duc
de
la
Victoria
was
an
exception
--
We
were
two
blocks
from
Las
Ramblas
and
walking
distance
to
everything
we
wanted
to
see
plus
three
metro
stations
but
the
hotel
itself
was
virtually
silent
.
We
had
no
trouble
sleeping
!
The
room
was
small
but
adequate
with
a
comfy
bed
and
private
bathroom
.
If
I
visit
Barcelona
again
in
the
future
I
will
only
stay
at
the
NH
Duc
de
la
Victoria!Helpful
hint
:
Try
the
Rick
Steves
guide
to
Spain
Portugal
especially
his
tours
and
restaurant
recomendations
.
good
hotel
...
but
noisy
elevators
!
I
stayed
one
night
in
June
.
Rooms
are
OK
with
very
nice
flat
screen
Televisions
.
Swimming
pool
and
business
center
were
great
with
friendly
and
helpfull
staff
.
Could
also
not
complain
about
the
quality
of
breakfast
.
But
the
worst
is
the
noise
of
the
elevators
.
I
you
wish
to
stay
there
do
not
forget
to
ask
for
a
room
FAR
AWAY
from
the
elevators
.
I
will
not
come
back
to
the
Millenium
just
because
of
that
.
Very
disappointing
hotel
Good
points
:
great
location
so
handy
for
main
part
of
Florence
all
the
attractions
and
restaurants
.
Staff
on
the
night
shift
were
very
friendly
eager
to
please
and
liked
to
chat.Bad
points
:
room
not
dissimilar
to
a
prison
cell
.
Tiny
unrecognisable
from
any
photos
we
have
seen
on
the
website
.
It
was
in
the
back
of
the
hotel
and
was
barely
big
enough
for
two
people
.
The
hallway
and
all
the
corridors
smell
of
musty
food
or
something
equally
distasteful
.
We
were
on
the
top
floor
-LRB-
five
flights
of
winding
stairs
-RRB-
and
with
no
lift
I
do
not
know
how
most
people
get
their
cases
up
the
stairs
.
I
am
a
sportsman
and
over
6
foot

so
managed
...
barely
!!!
General
tip
:
if
you
are
here
for
a
short
time
this
hotel
will
suffice
but
for
a
special
occasion
do
not
bother
you
will
be
disappointed
.
Not
really
reflective
of
the
price
-
more
like
a
no
frills
experience
.
Perfect
hotel
The
hotel
is
unique
.
Rooms
are
designed
with
perfect
style
.
You
feel
like
staying
in
somebody
&#039;
s
home
-
not
in
hotel
.
I
tried
a
dozen
hotels
in
A
&#039;
DAM
-
this
on
is
the
best
.
Perfect
balance
between
quite
nice
street
and
short
distance
to
everything
.
Had
a
perfect
stay
perfect
.
Stayed
just
1
evening
.
Booked
a
Junior
Suite
but
was
upgraded
without
even
requesting
upon
arrival
.
Made
specific
requests
in
my
email
booking
and
the
hotel
bent
over
backwards
to
accomodate
.
Room
was
beautiful

-LRB-

fantastic
.
The
staff
were
just
so
so
friendly
.
Really
helpful
and
understanding
.
Hotel
location
is
perfect
.
Barcelona
has
a
serious
traffic
problem
so
being
just
a
touch
out
from
the
centre
was
perfect
.
No
problem
with
noise
from
harbour
sound
insulation
anywas
was
amazing
.
Quite
simply
can
not
fault
hotel
in
any
way
and
would
definitely
return
next
time
I
am
in
Barcelona
.
Another
thing
.
I
am
quite
a
down
to
earth
guy
but
for
sure
one
does
NOT
have
to
meet
the
stereotypical
image
of
a
Businessman
to
be
treated
like
a
lord
here
.
All
appear
to
be
considered
equal
as
it
should
be
.
perfect
for
us
!!!
I
rely
heavily
on
reviews
within
this
forum
.
.
so
I
thought
I
would
add
mine
on
the
Hampton
Inn
in
the
Garden
District
.
It
was
perfect
for
us
...
my
daughter
and
I
were
traveling
to
Tulane
and
I
was
looking
for
accomadations
between
downtown
and
the
school
.
Service
and
Hotel
:
The
staff
was
very
friendly
and
went
out
of
their
way
to
be
helpful
.
We
arrived
at
about
10:30
for
check
in
and
they
were
not
ready
for
us
...
but
quickly
found
us
a
room
.
The
room
was
clean
enought
...
but
the
really
great
thing
was
how
comfortable
the
bed
was
.
It
had
6
comfy
useable
pillows
and
a
down
comforter
covered
with
a
duvet
...
as
most
of
us
do
not
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
the
room
.
.
this
great
bed
and
hot
shower
were
just
perfect.It
is
about
a
2
mile
distance
to
Tulane
which
was
perfect
for
a
walk
...
Within
the
area
is
a
Rite
Aid

The
Superior
Grill
which
has

and
huge

with
a
great
bar
and
really
nice
Sunday
Brunch
Cannon
&#039;

The
Hampton
Inn
worked
really
well
for

and
daughter
wanting
to
see
a
little
more
than
the
french
quarter
...
although
we
have
done
that
too.T
Sleepless
...
...
We
arrived
in
Seattle
after
a
long
flight
from
London
and
our
first
impression
of
the
Sheraton
was
very
good
.
The
external
facade
was
impressive
the
reception
bright
spacious
and
airy
and
we
received
a
warm
welcome.Unfortunately
once
we
got
to
our
Club
Level
Room
things
began
to
go
downhill
.
The
room
whilst
spacious
and
clean
looked
tired
and
outdated
the
colour
scheme
being
shades
of
beige
.
The
bathroom
was
small
and
the
bathtub
was
about
a
foot
deep
and
practically
useless
.
However
the
worst
was
yet
to
come
.
After
having
a
meal
in
the
Daily
Grill
which
was
fairly
good
we
went
to
bed
.
That
is
when
the
doors
started
slamming
...
...
.
.
all
night
!
The
door
mechanisms
failed
to
work
so
when
everybody
entered
or
exited
their
rooms
the
door
slammed
.
You
could
hear
doors
slamming
10
rooms
away
and
it
coninued
into
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
.
Hence
we
did
not
have
a
proper
nights
sleep
for
3
nights.When
I
raised
the
issue
with
the
front
desk
they
knew
immediately
what
I
was
coplaining
about
so
why
has
this
not
been
resolved
?
This
just
shows
contempt
for
the
customer.This
is
unacceptable
for
any
standard
of
hotel
never
mind
a
four
star
establishment
.
I
received
a
fifty
dollar
per
night
credit
but
frankly
would
have
preferred
to
sleep.In
conclusion
I
would
not
recommend
this
hotel
until
they
take
the
comfort
of
their
guests
more
seriously
and
sort
out
the
doors.In
truth
it
was
an
average
hotel
with
a
significant
problem
.
Good
Experience
I
am
a
very
frequent
business
traveller
to
Manhattan
but
this
was
the
first
time
I
had
stayed
here
.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
-
the
toom
was
fairly
large
clean
and
the
bathroom
in
excellent
condition
.
Everything
in
the
room
worked
.
The
bed
was
very
comfortable
and
there
was
little
or
no
noise
-LRB-
my
room
was
on
the
42nd
floor
-RRB-
.
All
in
all
a
minor
miracle
considering
where
you
are
-
one
block
from
Times
Square
.
And
if
you
don
&#039;
t
like
the
in-house
food
there
are
millions
of
options
within
a
mile
radius.Service
-
I
liked
the
one
touch
service
-
you
call
one
number
to
get
access
to
all
services
rather
than
having
to
call
room
service
housekeeping
etc.
separately
.
Some
service
gripes
made
me
reduce
my
rating
:
my
in-room
dining
cart
and
cutlery
was
not
removed
from
room
for
an
entire
24-hour
period
although
multiple
housekeeping
staff
would
have
seen
it
.
Secondly
as
a
business
traveller
I
travel
with
two
laptops
but
I
had
to
pay
twice
for
Internet
access
once
for
each
computer
.
Central
service
express
just
told
me
to
put
my
cart
in
the
hallway
and
in
relation
to
the
Internet
issue
said
that
that
was
just
the
way
it
was
.
Really
superior
customer
service
would
have
apologized
for
rhe
first
issue
and
waived
the
extra
Internet
fee
.
Polite
Mayfair
Hotel
This
hotel
really
does
seem
an
incredible
deal
in
upscale
Mayfair
with
the
Ritz
the
Connaught
and
Claridge
&#039;
s
all
nearby
neighbors
.
My
partner
and
I
checked
with
the
hotel
directly
through
their
website
and
got
a
great
rate
including
an
English
breakfast
for
under
$
350
--
that
with
the
exchange
rate
so
terribly
bad
these
days
.
The
front
desk
service
was
incredibly
efficient
and
polite
;
the
maid
service
was
prompt
;
the
turn-down
service
a
nice
touch
;
and
the
very
nice
inclusive
breakfast
was
the
perfect
way
to
start
a
day
of
sight-seeing
.
As
a
tourist
visiting
for
four
days
the
Chesterfield
really
offered
a
glimpse
into
what
a
sophisticated
upscale
hospitable
city
London
can
be
.
The
hotel
is
convenient
to
the
Green
Park
Underground
stop
and
with
Shepherd
&#039;
s
Market
offering
a
variety
of
shops
and
cafe
&#039;
s
nearby
and
Bond
Street
and
Oxford
Street
also
within
easy
walking
distance
one
could
spend
an
entire
day
shopping
very
close
to
your
hotel
.
And
while
you
&#039;
re
staying
at
the
Chesterfield
go
ahead
and
have
dinner
nearby
at
The
Square
--
one
of
the
best
dinners
we
have
had
anywhere
.
Just
a
great
experience
in
this
part
of
town
staying
at
the
Chesterfield
.
We
hope
to
be
back
someday
.
Extraordi-Neri
It
would
be
easy
to
run
down
a
hotel
when
the
whole
of
your
visit
to
supposedly
sunny
Barcelona
is
blighted
by
incessant
rain
.
However
it
would
be
difficult
to
fault
the
Neri
.
The
service
was
extremely
friendly
and
the
room
was
fantastic
.
Its
location
in
the
heart
of
the
Barri
Gotic
is
convenient
for
getting
around
and
also
for
local
bars
and
restaurants
-LRB-
the
Cuines
Santa
Caterina
is
well
worth
a
visit
-RRB-
.
The
interior
modernity
of
the
hotel
comes
as
a
surprise
when
viewed
from
outside
-
it
is
a
clever
blend
of
old
and
new
.
Not
that
its
the
be-all
of
a
holiday
but
the
wi-fi
service
worked
extremely
well
.
Would
definitely
recommend
.
Great
Breakfast
During
our
four
days
&#039;
stay
in
Hyatt
the
most
memorable
thing
was
their
breakfast
buffet
-LRB-
which
was
included
for
the
hotel
guests
-RRB-
.
The
breakfast
serves
western
traditional
breakfast
food
with
the
additions
of
tasty
Asian
choices
-LRB-
there
are
a
lot
of
Asian
tourists
staying
in
the
hotel
-RRB-
.
The
staff
was
very
friendly
and
efficient
.
The
room
we
stayed
at
wasn
&#039;
t
impressive
.
It
was
rather
small
.
There
is
no
fridge
.
We
rented
a
fridge
from
the
hotel
for
about
$
15
.
The
fridge
was
tiny
.
We
liked
the
pool
and
hot
tubs
.
Every
night
there
was
live
music
entertainment
at
the
pool
area
.
The
spa
facility
was
nice
but
pretty
pricy
.
Overall
we
had
a
pleasant
experience
staying
at
Hyatt
in
Waikiki
would
recommend
it
to
others
.
great
hotel
amazing
breakfast
We
loved
this
hotel
.
The
decorbathroombedding
and
most
important
the
great
spread
of
breakfast
.
The
breakfast
alone
was
worth
twenty
Euro
and
I
miss
it
very
much
.
The
staff
was
nice
and
spoke
great
english
.
The
only
negative
is
the
location
.
The
bus
ride
was
like
15
minutes
.
I
highy
reccomend
Quatro
Amici
near
the
station
for
a
great
lunch
and
dinner
.
Have
a
great
hot
chocolate
at
Rivore
and
eat
all
the
gelato
you
can
all
over
.
Still
the
Best
Stayed
at
this
hotel
last
year
and
had
an
excellent
stay
so
when
heading
to
Paris
again
at
the
beginning
on
January
08
had
no
second
thoughts
on
where
to
stay.The
service
and
staff
were
excellent
.
The
room
was
clean
and
well
appointed
.
The
staff
even
gave
us
help
when
having
problems
checking
in
flight
online
.
A
wonderful
stay
and
if
I
&#039;
m
back
in
Paris
again
next
year
it
will
be
back
here
.
The
most
fabulous
stay
!
The
bathroom
Good
Value
A
bit
hard
to
find
at
first
but
good
value
for
the
money
.
We
tried
to
check
out
at
7:15
AM
but
no
one
was
at
the
front
desk
-LRB-
closed
between
11
PM
and
7
AM
-RRB-
.
Called
the
main
number
from
our
room
to
find
out
that
the
individual
was
running
a
little
late
;
we
did
make
our
train
.
excellent
hotel
After
a
long
flight
from
Pennsylvania
to
Hawaii
we
were
pleased
with
the
quality
of
this
hotel
.
Free
Internet
service
in
the
rooms
was
a
huge
plus
as
we
were
able
to
tell
family
friends
that
we
made
it
safely
.
Nice
pool
.
Large
clean
room
.
Excellent
service
.
Hotel
stored
our
bags
for
the
day
-LRB-
for
a
fee
of
course
-RRB-
and
had
no
trouble
finding
htem
once
we
returned
.
Cabs
readily
available
.
Reception
gave
good
directions
for
taking
bus
to
see
Pearl
Harbor
.
No
problems
great
location
This
was
my
first
time
booking
a
hotel
in
NYC
.
After
reading
lots
of
reviews
for
lots
of
hotels
some
of
which
sounded
scary
I
opted
for
a
relatively
expensive
but
safe
bet
.
The
Hotel
Metro
matched
my
expectations
.
There
were
no
problems
at
all
.
I
had
a
single
room
with
a
king
size
bed
.
It
was
small
but
comfortable
.
The
amenities
-LRB-
bed
towels
toiletries
TV
etc.
-RRB-
were
those
of
an
average
hotel
like
a
Holiday
Inn
.
The
staff
were
professional
but
not
particularly
friendly
or
helpful
.
The
location
is
really
great
half
a
block
from
the
subway
at
Herald
Square
plus
there
are
quite
a
few
places
to
eat
around
the
hotel
especially
Korean
food
.
Think
Twice
We
were
greeted
by
an
outrageously
surly
registration
clerk
.
Our
party
of
three
rooms
was
split
between
the
hotel
&#039;
s
two
towers
so
each
room
visit
meant
35
floors
down
one
tower
crossing
the
lobby
and
going
35
floors
up
the
other
tower
.
The
beds
were
rock
hard
.
The
rooms
at
the
same
rate
were
dramatically
different
in
size
shape
and
amenities
.
Our
room
did
have
a
spectacular
view
.
The
mini
bar
is
not
stocked
by
the
maids
it
&#039;
s
stocked
later
in
the
day
by
a
second
surprise
visitor
.
The
cost
for
two
bowls
of
cereal
a
juice
and
two
coffees
in
the
hotel
restaurant
was
$
45
.
The
concierge
was
helpful
.
The
rooms
felt
clean
albeit
quite
worn
.
Our
room
had
pink
spots
all
over
the
floor
.
The
hotel
is
not
especially
well
located
it
is
a
jaunt
from
Grand
Central
station
and
a
bit
of
a
long
cab
ride
from
Penn
Station
.
The
area
empties
out
on
weekends
and
there
are
few
restaurants
to
walk
to
.
The
first
30
floors
apparently
belong
to
the
building
next
door
so
prepare
for
long
elevator
rides
.
Everyone
had
his
or
her
hand
out
and
even
ice
requires
hotel
employee
delivery
.
We
noticed
our
tv
audio
was
restricted
to
a
very
low
maximum
.
Fantastic
hotel
and
location
.
Stayed

London

Great
Location
I
have
stayed
in
several
Radisson
SAS
Hotels
-LRB-
Paris
Amsterdam
Prague
etc
-RRB-
and
this
one
is
defiantly
near
the
top
of
the
heap.I
stayed
in
an
well
appointed
King
Junior
Suite
with
amazing
views
over
the
Berliner
Dom
Museumsinsel
-LRB-
Museum
Island
-RRB-
and
the
old
East
German
Parliament
building
&#039;
Palast
der
Republik
or
&#039;
Palace
of
the
Republic
&#039;
-LRB-
which
after
many
years
is
finally
being
pulled
down
-RRB-
The
Hotel
is
modern
sleek
and
provides
excellent
modern
amenities
.
The
cylindrical
aquarium
that
is
in
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
is
truly
amazing
and
can
be
viewed
from
the
elevator
as
you
are
travelling
to
your
floor.The
Hotel
is
well
located
on
the
River
Spree
and
is
close
to
Hackescher
Markt
and
the
adjoining
S
Bahn
which
runs
all
the
ways
out
to
Flughafen
Schonefeld
-LRB-
Airport
-RRB-
on
the
S9
Line
.
There
are
also
some
great
restaurants
in
the
Hackescher
Markt
area.I
would
definitely
recommend
this
hotel
to
anyone
who
is
considering
staying
in
Berlin
whether
for
business
or
Leisure
.
Great
place
for

SCARY
!!
Inconsistent
We
arrived
at
the
Eliot
after
spending
a
wonderful
night
at
the
Lenox
.
The
Eliot
is
closer
to
The
Boston
Conservatory
so
that
is
where
I
initially
wanted
to
stay
but
there
was
no
room
the
first
night
so
we
stayed
at
the
Lenox
.
The
rather
small
but
charming
lobby
of
the
Eliot
was
somewhat
chaotic
as
a
large
group
was
checking
out
.
It
was
raining
when
we
arrived
in
the
evening
and
there
was
no
doorman
to
greet
us
or
bellman
to
help
us
with
the
bags
.
There
were
steps
to
enter
the
hotel
and
steps
to
go
down
to
the
lobby
and
carrying
the
luggage
was
not
easy.The
room
was
nicely
decorated
.
Clean
bathrooms
cute
window
seats
very
charming
.
The
beds
were
very
comfortable.In
room
internet
access
was
a
$
10
charge
which
I
think
should
have
been
included.Turn
down
service
was
offered
nightly
.
The
neighborhood
is
very
convenient
to
shopping
-LRB-
Newberry
Street
-RRB-
and
is
very
close
to
both
Berklee
and
The
Boston
Conservatory.Upon
checking
out
once
again
...
no
help
.
Lugging
bags
to
the
street
and
hailing
a
cab
ourselves.After
arriving
home
I
received
$
10.00
fee
adjustment
on
my
bill
for
a
luggage
tag
.
I
was
told
I
had
taken
this
from
the
room
.
I
can
assure
you
I
have
no
luggage
tag
.
I
have
asked
for
this
fee
to
be
removed
and
was
told
that
it
would
be
but
as
of
today
it
still
remains
.
Mediocre
at
best
for
what
you
pay
for
If
you
are
not
forced
to
stay
at
this
hotel
by
your
job
because
of
a
conference
...
stay
away
by
all
means
.
At
235
euro
per
room
it
&#039;
s
a
mediocre
attempt
to
provide
luxury
with
unfriendly
staff
not
above
average
amenities
ok
rooms
but
with
no
touch
of
class
.
And
if
you
are
visiting
Barcelona
you
most
likely
want
to
see
the
magnificent
sights
in
the
center
this
hotel
is
at
least
a
30min
drive
from
the
center
.
It
&#039;
s
in
a
non
residential
new
area
of
the
town
near
the
harbor
that
after
7pm
you
rarely
see
anybody
go
by
.
All
in
all
...
wouldn
&#039;
t
stay
there
again
