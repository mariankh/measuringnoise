While
theres
a
sober
beauty
to
much
of
the
film
it
does
drag
on
a
little
and
you
find
yourself
wondering
what
exactly
is
the
point
that
Geyrhalter
is
trying
to
make
Dysfunctional

but
the
films
power
comes
in
the
gradual
lessening
of
the
defenses
as
the
men
reach
out
into
devastating
honesty
Some
of
the
purely
medical
scenes
here
will
test
your
capacity
for
human
suffering
but
thats
a
minuscule
impression
of
horrors
these
doctors
face
daily
in
farflung
corners
of
the
globe
In
doing
some

Far
from
the
Wim
Wenderss
End
of
Violence
premise
it
could
signify
the
end
of
the
world
as
we
know
it
Its
an
incredibly
violent
insanely
entertaining
movie
that
features
scores
of
baddies
getting
killed
by
sword
arrow
knife
boiling
oil
even
a
stampede
of

Wait

Not

A
spirited
celebration
of

The
lowbudget
Australian
thriller
actually
gets
crazier
and
more
offbeat
as
it
goes
Its
worth
it
just
to
watch
things
spiral
so
far
out
of
control
In
Batman

If
you
have
the
patience
to
sit
through
a
slowmoving
romance
and
you
lack
the
vanity
to

put
off
by

youll
greatly
appreciate
the
light
at
the
end
of
Brokeback
Mountain
a
work
of
art
thats
more
than
just
a
movie
Duvall
Murray
Cobbs
and
Black
show
off
their
amazing
talent
and
bring
this
simple
but
affecting
story
to
life
Obviously
the
dark
nature
of
the
story
will
turn
off
some
audiences
But
the
film
will
appeal
to
those
who
love
the
thriller
genre
Tense
kinetic
intelligent
and
real
It
is
as
much
as
anything
else
an
expression
of
a
personality
an
insistence
that
the
singular
voice
of
a
single
heart
has
meaning
and
can
speak
meaningfully
across
cultural
boundaries
both
real
and
created
Basu
strictly
observes
the
Bmovie
convention
of
giving
the

explosion
or

at
regular
intervals
If
you
dont
like
the
genre
wait
three
minutes
A
grisly
and
gripping
horror
movie
A
wearing
examination

this
taut

impeccably

frequently
funny
political
satire
though
its
hard
to
shake
the
nagging
feeling
that
its
closer
to

this

with
at

some
taste
and
skill
Youll
leave
the
theater
bruised
and
battered
but
youll
be
happy
about
it
a
sad
story
that
supports
the
idea
of
child
killers
as
often
victims
themselves
the
far
less
passionately
defended
point
of

The
Aviator

most
interesting
films
of
the
year

only
every

A
classic
in
the
literature
of
illness
brought
to
the
screen
with
all
its
creative
juices
intact
the
film
salutes
the
firepower
of
imagination
as
a
lifegiver
and
a
lifesustainer
These

are
a
dangerous

here
we
find
desperate

Its
an

gratifying
achievement
Kitchen
Stories
is
so
subtle
that
many
viewers
will
not
be

about
the

Chamber

But
if
the
essence
of
magic
is
its
makebelieve
promise
of
life
that
soars
above
the
material
realm
this
is
the
opposite
of
a
truly
magical
movie
Dropping

Apted
has
constructed
a

I
realized
yes
Yes
I
am
I
doubt
anyones
going
to
fall
in
love
with
this
version
but
its
a
commendable
addition
to
the
canon
that
does
a
good
job
of
condensing
the
story
Murray
is
outstanding
as
the
bearer
of
flawed
maturity
and
gnawing
melancholy
Though
it
falters
as
a
narrative
Tony
Takitani
sticks
in
the
mind
with
its
poetic
contemplativeness
Its
soundofsilence
narrative
speaks
louder
than
words
and
reveals
the
power
of
nuance
and
understatement
Deneuves
combination
of
dignity
and
a

ordinariness
is
just
right

watchable

sticks
it
to
the

Itll
be

frothy
for
some

but
its

leave
you
with
a
warm
glow
The
dedication
the

infectious
and
that
gives
this

a
leg
up
